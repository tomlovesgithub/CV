## Profile
I am a creative mind with a natural aptitude when it comes fixing things, making things, and taking things apart then realising exactly how i broke them.
Over the past four years I have worked in _many_ different roles, some part time work, other longer jobs. I was seeking a path to career, but rather gained valuable skills and grew personally.
Now, my creative ambitions led me to begin my programming journey. I hope to continue learning and specialise in frontend, react, web and app design.
After graduating Makers Academy bootcamp, I will be looking for my first role in tech. I would love to find a creative workplace that can benefit from, and challenge my abilities, helping me grow.


eg enthusiast with experience in, eg, eg, eg, HTML5, CSS, SQL Javascript and such frameworks as Rails, React MERN  .  I have a keen interest in , eg eg eg eg, renewable energies, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

Previously I worked as a practice manager in a hectic veterinary practice, a role that required working under pressure, a strong work ethic, and organization. 

I am looking for a software company that ... values mentorship and encourages growth both personally and professionally.
