## Profile
I am a creative mind with a natural aptitude when it comes to fixing things.
I've had experience programming in **Ruby**, **Javascript**, **HTML5**, **CSS**, **SQL** and such frameworks as **Rails** and **MERN** (Mongo, Express, Node.js and React).

Before starting my programming journey I had worked in a variety of different roles. I was seeking a path to a career, but rather gained valuable skills and grew personally.

I feel I've grown up during a special time for technology and have been engaged with technology from a young age. I've always had an interest in tech and hardware. Even before I began programming I was an advocate for cryptocurrencies and already had a keen interest in the potential of blockchain technology. 

My interests and creative ambitions led me to study at Makers, I am now looking for my first role in tech; I would love to find a creative workplace that can benefit from, and challenge my abilities, helping me continue to learn and progress.

## Skills

* **Observant and Inquisitive** - Programming has tested my eye for detail and I've learned a great deal by pulling threads when looking at other people's code, or debugging my own. Improving myself like this, I've become able to make informed decisions earlier in my work, and been alert to repeating errors. For example, experimenting with pure JS and HTML, my investigations brought me to learn about the events loop, valued information when I came to understanding the lifecycle methods and virtual DOM in React.

* **Creative and Conceptual Thinker** - After studying a foundation year in Fine Art, I've found added joy in work spanning different mediums. Since have found it important to breathe creative life into projects where possible ever since: Whether allowing a concept to inform decisions or thinking laterally and applying creative thinking to navigate novel situations. I find having a way to look at a problem from a fresh perspective can be informing, incentivising and helps to keep things fun wherever possible, especially when keeping myself and team engaged and enjoying the work

* **Aptitude for fast learning** - 
After gaining this skill from my varied work history, I found it transferable to my experience at Makers Academy. learning new things quickly. 
I feel confident in joining a workplace that requires me to learn new skills and would enjoy the opportunity to continue progressing.

* **Agile Development** - XP values were taught at Makers Academy Bootcamp and I found the Agile system of shared input, goals and work an efficient model for project development. Ideally I'd like to work somewhere with an Agile system and XP values.

* **Resourceful Problem Solver** -  I have always liked finding creative solutions for problems, diagnosing an issue and assessing what tools are available to solve the problem. I've enjoyed bringing this thinking to my debugging and troubleshooting process. 

* **Confident and Expressive** - My customer facing work history, varied life experiences and creative background has given me solid assurance in my ability to be confident and charismatic. This was particularly useful during my bootcamp where I was able to make friends and be part of strong communicative teams that remained goal-oriented and happy. I look forward to meeting and working with new people in my future workplace.
