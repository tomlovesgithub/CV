## Profile
I am a creative mind with a natural aptitude when it comes fixing things.
I've had experience programming in **Ruby**, **Javascript**, **HTML5**, **CSS**, **SQL** and such frameworks as **Rails**, **MERN** (Mongo, Express, Node.js and React).

Before starting my programming journey I had worked in a variety of different roles. I was seeking a path to career, but rather gained valuable skills and grew personally.

I feel I've grown up with at a special time for technology, and have been engaged with technology from a young age. I've always had an interest in tech and hardware. Even before i began programming i was an advocate for cryptocurrencies, and already had a keen interest in the potential of blockchain technology. 

My Interests and creative ambitions led me to study at Makers,
I am now looking for my first role in tech; I would love to find a creative workplace that can benefit from, and challenge my abilities, helping me continue to learn and progress.

|[Messenja-FullStack-App](https://github.com/tomlovesgithub/Messenja-fullstack-app) | Modelled from similar projects i've done in the past, this project was intended as a learning venture into react, and node libraries for fullstack development. A solo project intended as a learning experience following my bootcamp, I felt this project hugely successful in giving me an orientation to React, other Js frameworks and their respective test suites. | ~ 1 month |React, Axios, Node.js, Express.js, Mongo.db, Concurrently  | Cypress, Mocha, Supertest,  |

## Skills

* **Apt learner** - 
I found the experience of going back to study again a refreshing experience. I found the skills i had picked up from 
my varied work history were transferable experience when it came to learning new things quickly. The challenge of returning to study was made easier by the course structure, which challenged my independent learning skills and gave me confidence in my ability to learn new things. I feel ready to join a workplace that requires me to learn new skills and would definitely enjoy learning alongside others.

* **Agile Development** - [XP values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) were taught at Makers Academy Bootcamp and I found the AGILE system of shared input, goals and work an efficient model for project development. Ideally I'd like to work somewhere with an Agile system and XP values.

* **Resourceful Problem Solver** -  I have always liked finding out of the box solutions for problems, diagnosing an issue and assessing what available tools are in order to solve the problem. I've enjoyed bringing translating this thinking to my debugging and troubleshooting process. 

* **Confident and Expressive** - My customer facing work history, varied life experiences and creative background have given me solid assurance in my ability to be confident and charismatic. I look forward to meeting and working with new people in my future workplace.

* **Observant and inquisitive** -  Programming has tested my eye for detail and I've learned a great deal by *pulling threads* when looking at other peoples code, or debugging my own. Improving myself like this I've been more aware of repeating the same errors

* **Creative Approach** - After studying a foundation year in fine art, I've found extra joy in projects spanning different mediums, and always find it important to breath creative life into projects where possible. I find this can be informing, incentivising and fun.
