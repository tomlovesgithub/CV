## Profile
I am a creative mind with a natural aptitude when it comes fixing things.
I've had experience programming in **Ruby**, **Javascript**, **HTML5**, **CSS**, **SQL** and such frameworks as **Rails**, **MERN** (Mongo, Express, Node.js and React).

Before starting my programming journey I had worked in a variety of different roles. I was seeking a path to career, but rather gained valuable skills and grew personally.

I feel ive grown up with at a special time for technology, and have been engaged with technology from a young age. I've always had an intrest in tech and hardware. Even before i began programming i was an advocate for cryptocurrencies, and already had a keen interest in the potential of blockchain technology. 

My Interests and creative ambitions led me to study at Makers,
I am now looking for my first role in tech; I would love to find a creative workplace that can benefit from, and challenge my abilities, helping me continue to learn and progress.
